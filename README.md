## ‚öôÔ∏è Guidelines

- Each team must **fork this repository** before starting development.
- Rename your forked repository using your **official team name**.
- Update this README in the root of your repo and include: 
  - Team members' full names and emails  
  - The assigned problem statement (already allotted)
  - A quick start guide with examples to run your code
  - Any other details if we need to know
  
- Ensure **all code, documentation, and related work is committed to your forked repository**. 
- Make **regular commits** throughout the program. Your commit history will be considered during the evaluation to assess collaboration and progress.
- Each team is required to create an issue in the repository using the `aisoc-workspace` issue template. This issue must include the following details:

  - Team information  
  - Project title and problem statement  
  - Timeline with clear milestones  
  - Expected outcomes and deliverables  

All project-related discussions, updates, and queries must be conducted within this issue thread to ensure transparency and open collaboration across teams.

## Final Submission Guidelines

Please carefully follow the instructions below to ensure successful completion and evaluation of your project:

1. **Working Demo**  
   - Before the final submission, you must include a working demo of your project.  
   - The demo should clearly explain the problem statement and how your solution addresses it.  
   - Upload your project to a shared location (e.g., Google Drive) and include the access link.

2. **Presentation Requirement**  
   - You are required to prepare a brief presentation detailing your solution.  
   - This presentation must be delivered **offline** to the evaluation panel.  
   - The presentation will be scheduled towards the end of July.

3. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   - Your final evaluation and the issuance of a certificate of completion will be based on:
     - Submission of a working demo with a clear explanation.
     - A shared drive link to your project.
     - A completed offline presentation to the panel.
   - Any changes or deviations from these requirements must be discussed and approved by the program staff.  
   - Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in termination of your contract.

Please ensure all deliverables are ready and submitted according to the above criteria.
